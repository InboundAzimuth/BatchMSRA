# BatchMSRA

Just some stuff I was building for a friend of mine that had some issues following directions, this should work just fine now
I hope it does. 

Just run the batch file and the CMD window will open, this should work on all versions of windows, tested it on windows 7
and above
No clue about windows XP though.
